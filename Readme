"Rombus Game Boy camera dumper" extracts bmp photos from gb camera .sav files. 
It supports thumbnails and full size photos. It's a CLI software intended to run under GNU/Linux environments but as it uses only standard libraries it should run under other systems.

Fun fact: It does not have a validation that will prevent you for dumping pictures out of any binary aside gb camera .sav files. So if you ever wondered how mp3 (or any other binary) files would look like interpreted as images, you can try that out. 

At the moment it doesn't support game-faces nor music sheets.

For compiling you need gcc and just open a terminal in this directory and type:
  make
  
To get instructions on how to use the program run it without arguments.
